As mentioned **kapp-controller** provides package management and continuous delivery capabilities by utilizing `kapp` to track the resources, itâ€™s deploying.

kapp-controller has three primary use cases, which we will talk about:
- Continuous Delivery
- Package Consumption
- Package Authoring

##### Continuous Delivery
kapp-controller's **App** CRD provides a declarative way to install, manage, and upgrade applications on a Kubernetes cluster.

```editor:append-lines-to-file
file: kappctl-spring-petclinic.yaml
text: |
  apiVersion: kappctrl.k14s.io/v1alpha1
  kind: App
  metadata:
    name: spring-petclinic-kappctl
  spec:
    serviceAccountName: default
    fetch:
    - git:
        url: https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/carvel-simple-app-on-kubernetes
        ref: origin/develop
        subPath: config-step-2-template
    template:
    - ytt:
        inline:
          paths:
            values.yaml: |
              #@data/values
              ---
              hello_msg: "Hello TAP"
            ns-overlay.yaml: |
              #@ load("@ytt:overlay", "overlay")

              #@overlay/match by=overlay.all, expects="1+"
              ---
              metadata:
                #@overlay/match missing_ok=True
                #@overlay/remove
                namespace: ""
    deploy:
    - kapp: {}
```

If you deploy the App, kapp-controller will fetch the GitHub repo, template the subPath for us using ytt to override the default configuration values, and then create the resources for us.
```terminal:execute
command: kubectl apply -f kappctl-spring-petclinic.yaml
clear: true
```

You can have a look at the App via kubectl ...
```terminal:execute
command: kubectl get app.kappctrl.k14s.io spring-petclinic-kappctl
clear: true
```
or the recently released [kctrl CLI](https://carvel.dev/kapp-controller/docs/v0.36.1/app-command/).
```terminal:execute
command: kctrl app get -a spring-petclinic-kappctl
clear: true
```

And finally the resources it has deployed via
```terminal:execute
command: kubectl get service,deployment,pods
clear: true
```

kapp-controller automatically updates the resources in the cluster if the source, in our example the contents of the GitHub repo, change or reverts manual changes of resources in the cluster. This process is called reconciliation.
The periodic reconciliation can be paused by setting the `.spec.paused` configuration of the App to `true` or the `kctrl app pause` command to for example try something out by manually changing the resources.
The `kctrl app kick` command can be used to trigger reconciliatio and tail the app status till it reconciles if desired. It can also be used to restart periodic reconciliation for a paused app.

Let's execute the following command to clean up the directory and look at the **Package consumption** and **authoring** use-cases for the TAP installation in the next section.
```execute
kubectl delete -f kappctl-spring-petclinic.yaml
rm kappctl-spring-petclinic.yaml
```
